The dataset contains the solution of the elasticity PDE in 2500 different platehole domains.
The codes "platehole.py" and "platehole_nn.py" can be immediately run provided that the entire dataset (or, at least, the data for the shapes  
used for the training) are placed in a folder named "C1P2", placed in the same directory as the considered python file.
