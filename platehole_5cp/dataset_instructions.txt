The dataset contains the solution of the elasticity PDE in 2500 different platehole domains.
The code platehole_5cp.py can be immediately run provided that the entire dataset (or, at least, the data for the shapes used for the training) 
are placed in a folder named "C1", placed in the same directory as the platehole_5cp.py file.
